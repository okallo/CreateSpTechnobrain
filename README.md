# CreateSpTechnobrain
create sp and test it.
project is made in dotnet6 codefirst approach and it's a dotnet cli project(I am currently using linux for development)

Project contains console app that will prompt you for db username, dbpassword and dbname.
It adds a default test employee so as to enable running the app.
In the test project enter your connection string.

When testing ensure you run the console app first then the nunit testing app next.
Edit the test cases as required.
